# country_indicators
A json version of the UN's Human Development data, including inequality-adjusted indicators. I added ISO3 country codes to the data for easier processing. 
This json file was just a one-time thing, and for the moment I don't plan to keep it updated. 
Check directly the UN website if you need reliable, up-to-date data: https://hdr.undp.org/en/content/download-data
